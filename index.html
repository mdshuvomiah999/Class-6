          <h1>The most expensive MacBook Pro will set you back $6,099</h1>
          <p>
            Apple today announced the 14-inch MacBook Pro and 16-inch MacBook
            Pro featuring new M1 Pro and M1 Max chips. As impressive as they
            seem, these two laptops cost a lot of money, especially when you
            configure them with the goodies Apple actually showed at its event.
            The starting price of the 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M1 Pro CPU,
            16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD is $1,999, which is a pretty penny and
            about the average starting place for some workstations. The base
            16-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB SSD will
            cost you $2,499. The best laptop deals in October 2021 The best
            MacBook deals for October 2021 The best iPad deals of October 2021
            The thing is, as a content creator, I want the maxed-out 16-inch
            MacBook Pro with at least 64GB of RAM and an 8TB SSD. So I went to
            Apple's website and tricked out the new MacBook Pro with my desired
            top-tier specs. Unfortunately, the cost soared to a whopping $6,099.

          <h1>Company Background</h1>
          <p>
            Lenovo Group of China is the world's largest maker of personal
            computers. The company has recently been expanding its business in
            the peripheral fields, such as smartphones, tablet computers and
            enterprise servers, focusing on its so-called PC Plus strategy to
            diversify its product portfolio. The company is also stepping up
            efforts to develop wearable gadgets, aiming to become an all-around
            manufacturer in the information technology field. Founded by Liu
            Chuanzhi and his colleagues, Lenovo began as a PC sales unit in
            1984, when Liu was a researcher at the state-run Chinese Academy of
            Sciences. In the 1990s, the company started selling PCs under its
            own brand, building up sales by offering prices lower than those of
            its rivals. By the late 1990s, it had claimed the top share of the
            domestic PC market. Lenovo made big strides in the global market
            after acquiring the PC business of U.S. technology powerhouse IBM in
            2005. The company has rapidly expanded its overseas sales, helped by
            the global popularity of the ThinkPad brand, originally developed by
            IBM. Lenovo is also known for aggressively pursuing mergers and
            acquisitions. In 2011, it merged its PC operations with those of
            Japanese IT solutions provider NEC, launching a PC joint venture in
            Japan. In 2014, the Chinese company bought the Motorola's smartphone
            business from U.S. search giant Google. Chinese investment company
            Legend Holdings, which Liu heads, holds slightly more than 30% of
            Lenovo's outstanding shares. Lenovo is also known for its close ties
            with the Chinese government, a relationship that has been a source
            of Internet security concerns in the U.S. and Europe. Ensuring
            management transparency is seen as a main challenge facing the
            company as it grows.

          <h1>Company Background</h1>
          <p>
            ASUS comes from the last four letters of Pegasus, the winged horse
            in Greek mythology that represents the inspiration of art and
            learning. ASUS embodies the strength, creative spirit and purity
            symbolized by this regal and agile mythical creature, soaring to new
            heights of quality and innovation with each product it introduces to
            the market. Let's jump to the how it all started : Asus was founded
            in Taipei in 1989 by T.H. Tung , Ted Hsu, Wayne Hsieh and M.T. Liao,
            all four having previously worked at Acer as hardware engineers . At
            this time, Taiwan had yet to establish a leading position in the
            computer-hardware business. Intel Corporation would supply any new
            processors to more established companies like IBM first, and
            Taiwanese companies would have to wait for approximately six months
            after IBM received their engineering prototypes . According to the
            legend, the company created a prototype for a motherboard using an
            Intel 486 , but it had to do so without access to the actual
            processor. When Asus approached Intel to request a processor to test
            it, Intel itself had a problem with their motherboard. Asus solved
            Intel's problem and it turned out that Asus' own motherboard worked
            correctly without the need for further modification. Since then,
            Asus was receiving Intel engineering samples ahead of its
            competitors. On 9 March 2006 Asus was confirmed as one of the
            manufacturers of the first Microsoft Origami models, together with
            Samsung and Founder Technology . The company has kept on growing on
            since thenâ€¦..
