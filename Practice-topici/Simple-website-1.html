              Apple today announced the 14-inch MacBook Pro and 16-inch MacBook
              Pro featuring new M1 Pro and M1 Max chips. As impressive as they
              seem, these two laptops cost a lot of money, especially when you
              configure them with the goodies Apple actually showed at its
              event. The starting price of the 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M1
              Pro CPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD is $1,999, which is a pretty
              penny and about the average starting place for some workstations.
              The base 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB
              SSD will cost you $2,499. The best laptop deals in October 2021

              October 2021 The thing is, as a content creator, I want the
              maxed-out 16-inch MacBook Pro with at least 64GB of RAM and an 8TB
              SSD. So I went to Apple's website and tricked out the new MacBook
              Pro with my desired top-tier specs. Unfortunately, the cost soared
              to a whopping $6,099.

            <h1>The Company History</h1>
            <p>
              Lenovo Group of China is the world's largest maker of personal
              computers. The company has recently been expanding its business in
              the peripheral fields, such as smartphones, tablet computers and
              enterprise servers, focusing on its so-called PC Plus strategy to
              diversify its product portfolio. The company is also stepping up
              efforts to develop wearable gadgets, aiming to become an
              all-around manufacturer in the information technology field.
              Founded by Liu Chuanzhi and his colleagues, Lenovo began as a PC
              sales unit in 1984, when Liu was a researcher at the state-run
              Chinese Academy of Sciences. In the 1990s, the company started
              selling PCs under its own brand, building up sales by offering
              prices lower than those of its rivals. By the late 1990s, it had
              claimed the top share of the domestic PC market

              ASUS comes from the last four letters of Pegasus, the winged horse
              in Greek mythology that represents the inspiration of art and
              learning. ASUS embodies the strength, creative spirit and purity
              symbolized by this regal and agile mythical creature, soaring to
              new heights of quality and innovation with each product it
              introduces to the market.
