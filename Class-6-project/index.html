              Hounslow garage was opened by the London General Omnibus Company
              in 1913 on the former site of the District Railway's Hounslow Town
              station. The garage along with many others was requisitioned in
              the First World War. Hounslow was the subject of two firsts in
              1925 and 1930 with the first pneumatic tyre buses and the original
              Dennis Dart allocated respectively. The garage had one problem
              though: the roof was too low and only open toppers and single deck
              vehicles could use the depot until the mid-1930s when the roof was
              raised.[citation needed] A London Transport survey in 1947 found
              that 92 vehicles were allocated to Hounslow, a garage with a
              capacity of 72. This was mainly achieved by parking buses on a
              plot of land behind the garage that was also used to stand
              vehicles terminating there on layover. The garage was rebuilt in
              the early 1950s and included a new bus station in front of the
              garage. The planned allocation was now up to 120 vehicles,
              although the allocation in 2002 was 127.[citation needed]
              Hounslow's first one-man operated double deckers were MCW
              Metrobuses delivered in 1982 for routes 111 and 202. With the
              allocation still high, Hounslow runs a number of night services on
              behalf of other London United garages to enable it to fit the
              buses into the garage. It was also the first garage in London to
              operate a low-floor bus with the arrival of Wright Pathfinder
              bodied Dennis Lance SLF in December 1993.[17] There were plans to
              relocate the garage away from the town centre, and allow the
              expansion of the adjoining bus station. In 2005 an unsuccessful
              planning application for a site in Hanworth Road was lodged. This
              was largely due to a campaign by residents overlooking the site

            <h1>Production facilities Of Volvo Group</h1>
            <p>
              Volvo has various production facilities. As of 2022, it has plants
              in 19 countries, with 10 other countries having independent
              assemblers of Volvo products. The company also has product
              development, distribution, and logistics centers.[54] Its first
              plant for vehicle assembly, on the Hisingen island, was owned by
              SKF until it was made part of the Volvo company in 1930.[9] That
              year, Volvo acquired its supplier of engines in Skövde
              (Pentavarken).[55] In 1954, Volvo built a new truck assembly plant
              in Gothenburg and, in 1959–[9] 1964,[56] a car assembly plant in
              Torslanda.[9] The first truly branched away plant of Volvo was the
              Floby gearbox plant (100 kilometers to the northeast of
              Gothenburg), incorporated in 1958. In the 1960s and early 1970s,
              Volvo and its assembly partners opened plants in Canada, Belgium,
              Malaysia,[55] and Australia.[57] In the early part of that period
              Volvo also started to venture into vehicles other than passenger
              cars and road-going commercial vehicles by acquiring the
              Eskilstuna plant (Bolinder-Munktell).[55] From the 1970s onwards,
              Volvo set up various facilities (Bengtsfors, Lindesberg, Vara,
              Tanumshede, Färgelanda,[55] Borås[58]), most of them within a 150
              kilometer radius of Gothenburg,[55] and gradually acquired the
              Dutch DAF car plants.[9] It also established its first South
              American plant in Curitiba, Brazil.[59] From the mid-1970s
              onwards, Volvo began building assembly plants with smaller
              assembly lines, more worker-centric and with better use of
              automation, leaving Fordism. These were Kalmar (car assembly,
              built in 1974),[56] Tuve (truck assembly, 1982)[56][60] and
              Uddevalla (car assembly, 1989). Kalmar and Uddevalla were closed
              down in the early 1990s, following yearly losses.[56] The Tuve
              plant (called the LB plant) replaced the Gothenburg plant (X
              plant) for truck assembly through the 1980s, as the former could
              produce more technologically complex models.[60] In 1982, Volvo
              gained its first plant in the United States, the New River Valley
              plant in Dublin, Virginia, after acquiring the assets of the White
              Motor Corporation.[17] Starting in the late 1980s, Volvo expanded
              its limited bus production capabilities through acquisitions in
              various countries (Swedish Saffle Karroseri, Danish Aabenraa,
              German Drögmöller Karroserien, Canadian Prévost Car, Finnish
              Carrus, American Nova Bus, Mexican Mexicana de Autobuses). In the
              late 1990s, after a short-lived joint venture with Polish
              manufacturer Jelcz, Volvo built its main bus production hub for
              Europe in Wroclaw.[59] In the 1990s, Volvo also increased its
              construction equipment assets by acquiring the Swedish company
              Åkerman and the construction equipment division of Samsung Heavy
              Industries.[61] In 1998, the company opened an assembly facility
              for its three main heavy product lines (trucks, construction
              equipment, and buses) near Bangalore, India.

              AB Scania-Vabis was established in 1911 as the result of a merger
              between Södertälje-based Vabis and Malmö-based
              Maskinfabriks-aktiebolaget Scania. Vagnfabriks Aktiebolaget i
              Södertelge (Vabis) was established as a railway car manufacturer
              in 1891, while Maskinfabriks-aktiebolaget Scania was established
              as a bicycle manufacturer in 1900. Both companies had tried their
              luck at building automobiles, trucks and engines, but with varied
              success. In 1910, Maskinfabriks-aktiebolaget Scania had succeeded
              in constructing reliable vehicles, while Vabis was at the brink of
              closing down. An offer from Per Alfred Nordeman, managing director
              of Maskinfabriks-aktiebolaget Scania, to steel manufacturer
              Surahammars Bruk, owner of Vabis, led to an agreement in November
              1910, and in 1911 the merger was a reality. The new generation
              Scania S series (right) R series (left) Development and production
              of engines and light vehicles were set to Södertälje, while trucks
              were manufactured in Malmö. The company's logo was redesigned from
              Maskinfabriks-aktiebolaget Scania's original logo with the head of
              a griffin, the coat of arms of the Swedish region Scania (Skåne),
              centered on a three-spoke bicycle chainset. Initially the
              headquarters were located in Malmö, but in 1912 they were moved to
              Södertälje.

              A-buses are a type of city bus in Copenhagen that run frequently
              and make use of many stops around the city. They were introduced
              on October 20, 2002, by the now-defunct HUR Trafik, to coincide
              with the opening of the first stage of the Copenhagen Metro.
              Today, the A-buses are run by Movia, who outsource operations to
              various contractors. The buses are easily identifiable as yellow
              with red corners at the front and back. As of October 13, 2019,
              there are 6 A-bus lines, and a further three which have been
              discontinued and one further line which was integrated into the
              Cityring. During rush hour, the buses don't follow a specific
              timetable, but they run instead at regular intervals which can be
              as short as 3–4 minutes. In the evenings, there are about 10
              minutes between each A-bus, while at night they run every 20 to 30
              minutes. On some stretches, however, only every other bus serves
              the entirety of the route. In 2019, the seven, and later six,
              A-bus lines carried 52.9 million passengers, equivalent to 26.7%
              of all Movia's passengers. A-buses can also found in Køge,
              Roskilde, Ringsted, Holbæk and Helsingør, where Movia has set up
              several routes in each town between 2009 and 2011. This is also
              the case in Aarhus, where Midttrafik runs an A-bus service.
